This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug involving attempting to append a text node to a non-existent element using `document.createTextNode` and `appendChild`. The bug is subtle because it doesn't always throw a JavaScript error; instead, it silently fails.  The solution shows how to prevent this issue using proper error handling and checking for the element's existence before appending the text node.
